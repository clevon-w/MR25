## basic file directory
All the frontend shit goes inside the client folder.

All the backend shit goes inside the server folder. Inside the server folder there is the controllers and models folder which contains all the controllers and models for each collection inside the database.

## branch naming convention: 
```
<name>_<branch type>_<branch name>
```
  branch types :
    
    Bug Fix (bug)
    Hot Fix (hotfix)
    Feature Branches (feature)
    Experimental Branches (experiment)
    WIP branches (wip)
  Eg, clevon_feature_adding-mongodb

## file documentation:
 Every file/function should have some documentation at the top to say what the file/function do.
 
 Eg, 
 ```
 /**
  * This file does this.
  * This file contains this.
  */
  
  /**
   * functionName does this.
   * @params {type} param1 does that.
   * @return {type} returns those.
   */
 ```
 
 In general if you stick to this you will be quite safe
